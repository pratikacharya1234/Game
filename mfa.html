    <h2>What is Multi-Factor Authentication?</h2>
    
    <p>Multi-Factor Authentication, also called MFA or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), is a security method that requires you to provide two or more pieces of evidence to prove who you are before you can log into an account. Instead of just entering a password, you also need to provide a second factor like a code sent to your phone or a fingerprint scan. This makes your accounts much more secure because even if a hacker steals your password, they still cannot get into your account without that second factor.</p>
    
    <p>Think of MFA like having two locks on your front door instead of just one. A password is like the first lock - it keeps most people out. But if someone picks that lock or steals your key, they can get in. MFA is like adding a second lock that requires a different key. Even if someone has your password (the first key), they still need the second key to get in. This second factor is usually something only you have access to, like your phone or your fingerprint. Studies show that accounts with MFA are 99.9 percent less likely to be hacked compared to accounts that only use passwords.</p>
    
    <h2>The Three Types of Authentication Factors</h2>
    
    <p>MFA uses different types of factors to verify your identity. Here are the three main types:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Something You Know</strong> - This is information that only you should know, like a password, a PIN number, or the answer to a security question. This is the most common type of authentication factor.</li>
        <li><strong>Something You Have</strong> - This is a physical object that you own, like your smartphone, a security key, or a card. For example, many banks send a code to your phone that you need to enter when logging in.</li>
        <li><strong>Something You Are</strong> - This is a physical characteristic that is unique to you, like your fingerprint, your face, or your voice. Many phones now use facial recognition or fingerprint scanners as a second factor.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Why MFA is Important</h2>
    
    <p>MFA is important because passwords alone are no longer enough to protect your accounts. Hackers have many ways to steal passwords. They can guess weak passwords, trick you into giving them your password through fake emails (called phishing), or buy stolen passwords from the dark web. In 2024, millions of passwords were stolen from data breaches. When you use MFA, even if your password is stolen, the hacker still cannot access your account without the second factor.</p>
    
    <p>Many important services now require or strongly recommend using MFA. Banks, email providers, social media sites, and work accounts often have MFA options available. Setting up MFA is usually very easy and only takes a few minutes. Once it is set up, it only adds a few seconds to your login time, but it makes your account much more secure. Security experts recommend that everyone should turn on MFA for their most important accounts like email, banking, and social media.</p>
    
    <h2>Common MFA Methods</h2>
    
    <p>There are several ways to use MFA. Here are the most common methods:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SMS Text Messages</strong> - A code is sent to your phone via text message that you enter when logging in</li>
        <li><strong>Authenticator Apps</strong> - Apps like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator generate codes on your phone</li>
        <li><strong>Email Codes</strong> - A verification code is sent to your email address</li>
        <li><strong>Biometrics</strong> - Using your fingerprint or face to verify your identity</li>
        <li><strong>Security Keys</strong> - Physical USB keys that you plug into your computer</li>
    </ul>
